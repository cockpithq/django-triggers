      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the analysis of current linting configuration into specific subtasks for each tool (flake8, isort, mypy) and a final subtask for creating the mapping document between current tools and Ruff equivalents.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires detailed analysis of multiple tools with different configuration formats. The complexity comes from needing to understand all current settings and creating a comprehensive mapping document."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Ruff linting configuration into subtasks for basic setup, rule mapping, special configurations (like per-file-ignores), testing equivalence with flake8, and documentation of differences.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to the detailed mapping required between flake8 and Ruff rules, ensuring equivalent coverage, and handling edge cases. This requires deep understanding of both tools."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Configure Ruff Formatter",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the formatter configuration into analyzing current isort settings, configuring Ruff formatter settings, testing on representative code samples, and documenting differences between tools.",
      "reasoning": "Formatting configuration requires careful attention to maintain consistency with existing code style while transitioning to a new tool. Testing and validation are critical to minimize disruption."

      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split this task into researching the appropriate Ty version and dependencies, then implementing the installation and verification steps.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to adding Ruff, this is a straightforward dependency addition with clear steps, though it requires confirming the correct version and any additional dependencies."

      "taskTitle": "Configure Ty Type Checking",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down Ty configuration into translating mypy settings, configuring Django support, testing with Django-specific code patterns, addressing compatibility issues, and documenting the final configuration.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks due to the need to configure a newer type checker to work with Django, potentially without established stubs. Requires deep understanding of type checking and Django internals."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the full codebase testing into separate subtasks for Ruff linting, Ruff formatting, Ty type checking, and comparative analysis with previous tools.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves running multiple tools across the entire codebase and performing detailed comparison of results. The complexity comes from the volume of data to analyze and the need to refine configurations based on findings."
