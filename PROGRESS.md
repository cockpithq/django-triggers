## PROBLEM: Needed to run tests

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Installed missing dependency `setuptools` using uv
- Successfully ran pytest with `python -m pytest --ds=tests.app.settings`
- All 17 tests passed with 89% code coverage

---

MEMO:

- Test suite requires Django settings to be specified with `--ds=tests.app.settings`
- There are some deprecation warnings that could be addressed in future updates

## PROBLEM: Testing Temporal workflow integration

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Verified Temporal server is running (localhost:7233)
- Attempted to run Temporal worker
- Ran test integration script

---

MEMO:

- Worker failed with "Failed validating workflow trigger_workflow" error
- Test script reported "workflow not found for ID: trigger-1-1-1"
- Temporal integration is configured but seems to have implementation issues
- Trigger is present in the database
